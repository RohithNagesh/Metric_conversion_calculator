# Metric_conversion_calculator
Metric conversion is the process of converting measurements from one unit of the metric system to another. The metric system is an international decimal system of measurement that is widely used around the world, and it is based on units of ten, which makes it easy to convert between different units.

In this repository i have written a python code which converts parameters like length, mass and time from SI to CGS, SI to FPS, CGS to FPS and vice versa

Graphical user interface (GUI) is used to make it easy to use and communicate
